[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:23 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findkinematics_interface.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "kinematics_interface", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by
  "kinematics_interface" with any of the following names:

    kinematics_interfaceConfig.cmake
    kinematics_interface-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "kinematics_interface" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
  or set "kinematics_interface_DIR" to a directory containing one of the
  above files.  If "kinematics_interface" provides a separate development
  package or SDK, be sure it has been installed.
